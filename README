# Serious Business Random Avatar Generator

Very important business demands very important avatars.

To request an avatar hit the endpoint [`/avatar`](/avatar).

Optionally add a `size`, or `s`, parameter with a single pixel dimension (since the avatar is square). The default is 80.

    /avatar?s=500

That will get you a largish sized avatar, for your business.

This works well with [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/), as a default avatar. 

What would you use these business avatars for? Well if you need to conduct yourself professionally on the Internet for instance. Or if you need some default avatars when developing a web-app with seed data for instance. The possibilities are nearly endless.
